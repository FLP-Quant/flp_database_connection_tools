# flp_database_connection_tools
Tools for connecting to, reading from, and writing to FirstLight's on-prem databases.

## Instructions for using the tools
The flp_data_connector class that lives in the "Helpers" subfolder contains the main code with functions to interact with the following databases:

The "Notebooks" subfolder contains Jupyter notebooks that can serve as examples or utilities to use that class to upload to query data.
